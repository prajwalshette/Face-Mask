# Face-Mask-Detection-using-CNN
During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus.Real-time Face Mask Detector with Python.
Real-Time Face Mask Detector with Python
We will build a real-time system to detect whether the person on the webcam is wearing a mask or not. We will train the face mask detector model using Keras and OpenCV.

## Download the Dataset
The dataset we are working on consists of 1376 images with 690 images containing images of people wearing masks and 686 images with people without masks.

## Face Mask Detection Alert System
1. Configure Working Directory and Mount Google Drive to make use of Google Colab.

2. Data Pre-processing to convert images to Grayscale and separate out labelsand images. 

3. Build a Convolutional Neural Network using Sequential API of Keras.

4. Train the Face Mask Detection Classifier on Image Data using Keras and Tensorflow as Backend.

5. Evaluate the model to see the Loss and Accuracy in Graphical form.

6. Save or Serialize the Face Detection Classifier Model.

7. Download the model on the Local System and Load it in the program.

8. Use the Live Webcam Video stream to Detect the Face.

9. Extract the Region of Interest of the Face.

10. Engage trained Face Mask Detection Model to the face identified and determine if the person is wearing Mask or Not.

 


## Letâ€™s dive into the code for face mask detector project:
We are going to build this project in two parts. In the first part, we will write a python script using Keras to train face mask detector model. In the second part, we test the results in a real-time webcam using OpenCV.
